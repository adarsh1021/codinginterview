# Heaps 
## What is a heap ?
A heap is a tree based data structure that satisfies a certain property called the heap property. Usually binary trees are used to create heaps.  
There are two types of heaps - min heap and max heap. 
#### Heap Property
The heap property is different for both min and max heaps.  
For a **min heap** the heap property can be defined as for a parent node P and it's children C1 and C2, the value of P should be less than or equal to the values of C1 and C2.  
For a **max heap** the heap property can be defined as for a parent node P and it's children C1 and C2, the value of P should be greater than or equal to the values of C1 and C2.
